## üß† LLMs

Ollama organizes model data into two primary components:

- **Model Blobs**:  
  Large binary objects that store the actual weights and parameters of a machine learning model. These are essential for performing inference or continuing training. They represent the core functional data of a model.

- **Manifests**:  
  Metadata files that define the model‚Äôs architecture, configuration, version, and dependencies. Manifests help with managing models systematically, facilitating reproducibility, compatibility, and deployment workflows.

## üîß Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

PEFT techniques allow efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs) by modifying only a small portion of the model‚Äôs parameters. This reduces computational requirements and helps preserve the model‚Äôs general capabilities.

### Key PEFT Methods:

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**  
  Introduces low-rank matrices into existing model layers to enable training with a reduced number of parameters while maintaining performance.

- **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)**  
  Combines LoRA with quantization (e.g., 4-bit precision), making fine-tuning significantly more memory-efficient.

- **Adapters**  
  Lightweight modules inserted between model layers that can be trained independently, enabling task-specific fine-tuning without altering the base model.

- **Prompt Tuning**  
  Learns task-specific soft prompts (parameter vectors) that steer the model during inference, avoiding changes to the original model weights.

## üß™ Other Fine-Tuning Strategies

- **Instruction Fine-Tuning**  
  Trains the model using examples that explicitly guide it on how to respond to user instructions.

- **Multi-Task Learning**  
  Fine-tunes the model on several related tasks at once, improving generalization across those tasks.

- **Sequential Fine-Tuning**  
  Adapts the model in stages, fine-tuning it on one task after another to specialize it incrementally.

- **Few-Shot Learning**  
  Embeds a few labeled examples directly into the prompt to help the model understand and adapt to new tasks with minimal training.

## üìä Hyperparameter Tuning

Effective fine-tuning requires careful selection and optimization of key hyperparameters:

- Learning rate  
- Batch size  
- Number of epochs  
- Optimizer selection  
- Dropout rate (for regularization)

Fine-tuning performance often hinges on well-tuned configurations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Preparation

The foundation of any successful fine-tuning process lies in high-quality, task-specific datasets:

- Ensure **clean, relevant, and well-labeled** data.
- Balance diversity and specificity to avoid overfitting or under-generalization.
- Preprocessing may include tokenization, normalization, deduplication, and filtering.

Well-prepared data enables the model to generalize better and align with downstream task objectives.
