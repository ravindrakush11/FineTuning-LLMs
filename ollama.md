## Understanding Ollamaâ€™s Model Storage

Ollama contains both model blobs and manifests.

* **'Model blobs'** are large binary objects that store the actual parameters and data of a machine learning model, essential for making predictions or further training.
* **Manifests** provide metadata and information about a machine learning model, including its architecture, hyperparameters, and version information, facilitating model selection and integration into production systems.
